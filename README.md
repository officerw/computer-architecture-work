All *.circ files contained in this project are digital circuits that may be simulated using a piece of software called Logisim. Given that development of the open source software is suspended as of 2014, this repository contains a .jar file to run Logisim and the corresponding .circ files. Information on the open source project can be found [here](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/index.html) as of 14 April 2024.
